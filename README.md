Datasets used: IMDB 5000 movies dataset & MovieLens small version dataset

- data folder contains the raw and preprocessed datasets
- Preprocessing codes folder contains Jupyter notebooks for stagewise data preprocessing
- Recommender codes folder contains Jupyter notebooks for recommendation systems based on three techniques - correlation based recommendation, Content based recommendation and collaborative filtering based recommendation
